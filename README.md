# BrainTumorClassification
This project is used to classify brain tumors when MRI scan images are provided to the model as input. It can classify the output into four types, out of which three are the types of brain tumors, namely, gliomas, meningiomas and pituitary tumors, and the fourth is a normal healthy brain with no tumor growth. 

This task is carried out by performing transfer learning using EfficientNet-B0.
